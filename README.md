# Key Getter
A tool to get input from terminal asynchronously.

This repository implemented `kbhit()`, `getch()` and `getchar()` for Linux. It can also detect the OS system and use `msvcrt` on Windows.

Tested on:
* Ubuntu 16.10(Linux 4.8.0), Python 2.7.12 and Python 3.5.2
* Windows 7 64 bit, Python 2.7.11

It may also support Mac OS, but I didn't test it. If you tried it on Mac, please tell me the result.
